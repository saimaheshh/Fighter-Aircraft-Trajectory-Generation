# Fighter-Aircraft-Trajectory-Generation

This repository contains MATLAB code for simulating the trajectory of an aircraft. The simulation considers various parameters and generates forces to simulate the aircraft's motion over a given time period.

## Description

This MATLAB script simulates the trajectory of an aircraft based on provided parameters such as mass, initial conditions, and force generation logic. The simulation considers forces in three dimensions (x, y, and z) and calculates the aircraft's position, velocity, and orientation over time.

## Features

- Aircraft trajectory simulation with customizable parameters.
- Forces generated based on a specified duration range.
- Visualization of the aircraft's trajectory in a 3D plot.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation on your local machine:

1. Ensure you have MATLAB installed.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
3. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd Aircraft-Trajectory-Simulation`
4. Open the MATLAB script: `AircraftTrajectorySim.m`
5. Run the script in MATLAB.

## Dependencies

No additional dependencies are required beyond MATLAB itself.


## Acknowledgements

The code is inspired by the need for a simple aircraft trajectory simulation for educational purposes.
